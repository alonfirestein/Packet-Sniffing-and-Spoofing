# Packet Sniffing and Spoofing  
### This project is part of the [SEED Labs](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/) workshop which focuses on packet sniffing and spoofing.  
  ## 
### Project Summary:  

Packet sniffing and spoofing are two important concepts in network security; they are two major threats in network communication. Being able to understand these two threats is essential for understanding security measures in networking. There are many packet sniffing and spoofing tools, such as Wireshark, Tcpdump, Netwox, Scapy, etc. Some of these tools are widely used by security experts, as well as by attackers. Being able to use these tools is important for students, but what is more important for students in a network security course is to understand how these tools work, i.e., how packet sniffing and spoofing are implemented in software.  
  
This projects covers some of the following topics:  

- Simulating an attacker and a user from two different machines connected to the same LAN using Docker containers  
- Packet sniffing using the pcap library and Scapy  
- Packet spoofing using raw socket and Scapy  
- Manipulating packets using Scapy
